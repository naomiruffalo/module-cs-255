DriverPass is an application designed to have driving students study and prepare for their driver's exam. Our client is called Liam. Liam wants us to design a software that works on and offline. This application should allow the user to download files, schedule appointments, take notes, and buy packages. 
We did particularly well in the design of the application. Our UML diagrams describe to the client specifically what will be done for the software. 
If I were to improve on one part of my design, I would improve in my technical requirements. I believe I could have expanded my description with them. 
I interpreted the user's needs by putting myself in their position and understanding what I would look for in an application. It is important to cinsider the user's needs when designing because the application is made for them because we can see exactly what we can do for the customers. 
I would approach this design software by first dividing work all over the scrum team. To analyze my last design I would give the software to testers to give some input on the software design and on what could be improved on.
